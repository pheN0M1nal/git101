		<h1>How Git works ?</h1>
		<p>
			Here is a basic overview of how Git works:<br /><br />

			1. Create a repository in your GitHub<br />
			2. Initialize Git in your project<br />
			3. Add and commit your project<br />
			4. Push your project to GitHub<br />
		</p>

		<h1>1. Creating a repository</h1>
		<p>
			Initially, the repository you create is going to be empty without any code
			in it. That's okay because you will start adding some files to it soon.
			This repository will be the central repository for your files, which means
			that others can access that repository if you give them permission. After
			creating a repository, you'll copy a version to your local system—that way
			you can update it from one repo, then transfer those changes to the other.

		<h1>2. Initialize Git in Project</h1>
		<p>
			We can't make use of Git in our project if we do not initialize/start it
			first with the git init command. So after creating the repository in
			GitHub, I'll open the project in my VS Code editor, go to my terminal, and
			then use the git init command to initialize/start. When you run this
			command in your terminal, you will notice some changes in color in your
			project. You will also see a U symbol which means your files are
			untracked. Also, when you open the folder where your project is
			stored/located, you will see another folder named .git which was
			automatically created when you ran the git init command.
		</p>

		<h1>3. Add and Commit your Project</h1>
		<h2>How to use the git add command</h2>
		<p>
			Adding the project to the staging area helps Git track your project and
			see changes you have made to it. To add your project to the staging area,
			run the git add . command. When you run this command, you will see that
			the U symbol automatically changes to A. This means that your files have
			been added to the staging area and are now being tracked by Git, waiting
			to be committed.
		</p>

		<h2>How to use the git commit command</h2>
		<p>
			By running the git commit command, you are saving this particular stage
			and t he changes to your project permanently in the Git repository. And
			although you might make few changes to the project in the future and
			commit them as well, this particular commit you made now will still be
			saved in the Git repository and can be accessed anytime. So after your
			project has been added to the staging area, the next thing you'll want to
			do is commit it by using the git commit –m “first commit” command. When
			you run this command, you should notice that the A symbol in the project
			in no longer there, and the project looks as you'd expect once again.

		<h1>4. Push your Project to GitHub</h1>
		<p>
			Pushing your project to Github helps prevent your project from getting
			corrupted/lost in the local storage. It also lets you access the GitHub
			repository freely from anyplace, with any computer (not necessarily your
			personal computer). To be able to push your project to the GitHub
			repository, you will have to add the remote repository you created in
			GitHub initially.<br />

			To do this, you will use the git remote add origin (repository name)
			command. In my case my repository name is: <br />
			https://github.com/ShaheerAziz/HowToUseGIT.git. Writing it in the terminal
			should look like this:

			<br /><br />git remote add origin<br />
			https://github.com/ShaheerAziz/HowToUseGIT.git<br /><br />

			Finally, after adding the remote repository where you want to upload the
			project and changing the branch to main, you'll want to push your project
			to GitHub. To achieve this, run the git push –u origin main command and
			wait for it to load completely. When this is done, go to the Git
			repository you created in GitHub and refresh the page. You will see that
			all your projects in the local repository have been uploaded to the GitHub
			repository.
